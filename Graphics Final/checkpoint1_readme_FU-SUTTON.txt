CheckPoint 1:
We were trying to finish the entire VR escape room as well as look into the construction of our maze.
-We were able to build the entire escape room. What we didnt get to work completely was the interactions between
	the user and their items and the environment
-We were able to work on a basic maze construction algorithm for our next checkpoint as well it is not complete and 
	needs to be modified

Time:
	Jacob + William: 1 hours in finding assets, modeling, and creating our escape room.
			 2 hours in trying to figure out how to do the interactions within VR using VIVE equipment
			 1.5 hours on working on the maze algorithm and generation

	William:	 2 hours making project work in vr with grabbing and moving
			 1 hour workign on maze generation

	Jacob: 		 another 2 hours on implementing the VR and trying to make the items/interactions working
